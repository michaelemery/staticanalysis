## FindBugs
All checkers except FindBugs only require source files, however FindBugs requires class files to work. You must therefore compile the source files before using FindBugs to check that program. 

## editing source files
To edit files, run `apt-get update`, then install vim `apt-get install vim` or nano `apt-get install nano`.
